                     BMP Peer Up Message Namespace
                     draft-ietf-grow-bmp-peer-up-05

Abstract

   RFC 7854, BGP Monitoring Protocol, uses different message types for
   different purposes.  Most of these are Type, Length, Value (TLV)
   structured.  One message type, the Peer Up message, lacks a set of
   TLVs defined for its use, instead sharing a namespace with the
   Initiation message.  Subsequent experience has shown that this
   namespace sharing was a mistake, as it hampers the extension of the
   protocol.

   This document updates RFC 7854 by creating an independent namespace
   for the Peer Up message.  It also updates RFC 8671 and RFC 9069 by
   moving the defined codepoints in the newly introduced registry.
   Compliant implementations of RFC 7854, RFC 8671 and RFC 9069 also
   comply with this specification.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7854] defines a number of different BMP message types.  With the
   exception of the Route Monitoring message type, these messages are
   TLV-structured.  Most message types have distinct namespaces and IANA
   registries.  However, the namespace of the Peer Up message overlaps
   that of the Initiation message.  As the BGP Monitoring Protocol has
   been extended, this oversight has become problematic.  In this
   document, we create a distinct namespace for the Peer Up message to
   eliminate this overlap, and create the corresponding missing
   registry.

   Compliant implementations of [RFC7854], [RFC8671] and [RFC9069] also
   comply with this specification.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  String Definition

   A string TLV is a free-form sequence of UTF-8 characters whose length
   in bytes is given by the TLV's Length field.  There is no requirement
   to terminate the string with a null (or any other particular)
   character -- the Length field gives its termination.

3.  Changes to existing RFCs

   [RFC7854] is updated as detailed in the following sub-sections.

3.1.  Revision to Information TLV, Renamed as Initiation Information TLV

   The Information TLV defined in section 4.4 of [RFC7854] is renamed
   "Initiation Information TLV".  It is used only by the Initiation
   message, not by the Peer Up message.

   The definition of Type = 0 is revised to be:

   *  Type = 0: String.  The Information field contains a string
      (Section 2).  The value is administratively assigned.  If multiple
      string TLVs are included, their ordering MUST be preserved when
      they are reported.

   *  Type = 1: sysDescr.  The Information field contains an ASCII
      string whose value MUST be set to be equal to the value of the
      sysDescr MIB-II [RFC1213] object.

   *  Type = 2: sysName.  The Information field contains an ASCII string
      whose value MUST be set to be equal to the value of the sysName
      MIB-II [RFC1213] object.

3.2.  Revision to Peer Up Notification

   The final paragraph of section 4.10 of [RFC7854] references the
   Information TLV (which is revised above (Section 3.1)).  That
   paragraph is replaced by the following:

Internet-Draft            BMP Peer Up Namespace             October 2024


   *  Information: Information about the peer, using the Peer Up
      Information TLV format defined below (Section 3.3).  The String
      type may be repeated.  Inclusion of the Information field is
      OPTIONAL.  Its presence or absence can be inferred by inspection
      of the Message Length in the common header.

3.3.  Definition of Peer Up Information TLV

   The Peer Up Information TLV is used by the Peer Up message.

     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   *  Information Type (2 bytes): defined types are:

      -  Type = 0: String.  The Information field contains a string
         (Section 2).  The value is administratively assigned.  If
         multiple strings are included, their ordering MUST be preserved
         when they are reported.

      -  Type = 3: VRF/Table Name.  The Information field contains a
         UTF-8 string whose value MUST be equal to the value of the VRF
         or table name (e.g., RD instance name) being conveyed.  The
         string size MUST be within the range of 1 to 255 bytes.

      -  Type = 4: Admin Label.  The Information field contains a free-
         form UTF-8 string whose byte length is given by the Information
         Length field.  The value is administratively assigned.  There
         is no requirement to terminate the string with null or any
         other character.

   *  Information Length (2 bytes): The length of the following
      Information field, in bytes.

   *  Information (variable): Information about the monitored router,
      according to the type.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a registry within the BMP group, named
   "BMP Peer Up Message TLVs", reference this document.

   Registration procedures for this registry are:

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not alter the security considerations of [RFC7854]
   which continue to apply.

6.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft.  The description of implementations in this section
   is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
   progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
   individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
   IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
   information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
   This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog
   of available implementations or their features.  Readers are advised
   to note that other implementations may exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of the BMP
   Peer Up Namespace:

   *  FRRouting

   *  pmacct
